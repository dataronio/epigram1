# Epigram 1

This is a version of Epigram 1, recovered from the Wayback Machine and
modified to build with current versions of GHC.

Current status: it builds using Stack, but the Elisp needs tweaking to
find the build product.

Tested on GNU/Linux, contributions and testing are welcome from Mac OS
and Windows users.

# Remaining Work

It would be convenient to get the interface to work with GNU Emacs

The current version here has not been thoroughly tested

# Installation Instructions

Run `stack build` to compile. Further instructions forthcoming.
